                <h2>Collecting Arcade Machines</h2>

                <strong>Hello!</strong> I have a hobby that I love. Since 2002 I have been collecting <mark>arcade and pinball machines</mark>.
                I started my collection when i was living in an apartment. Unfortunately the space was to limited and I wanted to take my hobby seriously, so I had to move.
                Now I am living in a house with a 100m2 garage which means that I have room for a few more games than I had in my apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the years I have been across the country and collected some nice machines, I have also been importing some machines from  <mark>Japan and Italy</mark>
            </p>
